# Lab 1

## Installing GHDL and GTKWave
I attempted to install GHDL and GTKWave on my MacBook, which is running macOS Sonoma. GTKWave is not compatible with macOS Sonoma, so I attempted to do multiple different work arounds to install it directly on my computer because I prefer that to an online simulator. Even after trying installation via Homebrew and under Rosetta 2, I was unable to successfully install it on my computer. 

I then tried to use EDA playground to complete the lab. However, I have never used EDA playground before so I was overwhelmed when I tried to understand what was happening. Even though I tried to follow steps, I was having difficulties with the interface. 

The next step I will try later, when I get home, is to use my Windows laptop to try and run it, hoping this will work to install it locally until I am more well-versed in online simulators such as EDA playground.
