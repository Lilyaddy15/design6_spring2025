I then obtained a Google Maps API Key and added it to index.html, and then used the following commands to copy static files

Using the following commands I updated the database and created a superuser

I then ran the server, and added in the data on the admin site. Then I saved it and opened the app.

Please note that the map is not correctly showing up. When I attempted to get an API key for Google Maps, it would not accept my credit card information and would not let me log in.
