### Start Django Project "stevens"
As shown below, I used commands in the terminal to start the Django project called "stevens"

I then adjusted the settings.py file as shown below

Then I copied the following files, as shown below

I then used the following commands to copy static files

Using the following commands I updated the database and created a superuser

I then ran the server, and added in the data on the admin site. Then I saved it and opened the app.

Please note that the map is not correctly showing up. When I attempted to get an API key for Google Maps, it would not accept my credit card information and would not let me log in. 

### Start Django REST Project
Using the commands shown below, I started a Django REST Project called mycpu

As shown, I then started the app, and adjusted the settings.py file

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 5 23 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9364aed-ee3b-4a71-890d-7d076a940142" />

Then I copied necessary files

<img width="520" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 5 28 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c47ec903-ca38-4a57-96ac-dbf603619589" />
<img width="540" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 5 32 08 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b46ba5-6865-4a47-b2c0-026cd4ae202b" />

Then I updated the database and created a superuser

<img width="541" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 5 36 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/084c2383-a583-49f9-a2bc-d5edcff33d01" />

After running the server and posting the necessary values to the different lists, ran ` controller.py `.

<img width="426" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7 39 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9498fe63-a5f6-4971-a94b-1fbfb83fb8b6" />

Then, I opened the app.

<img width="1327" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 5 48 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0211a3e-98f9-4a9a-bbdd-915e38028061" />

Again, please note that the map is not working due to the issue with not being able to get a proper API key.

### Running Flask

First, I installed flask using ` pip3 install flask ` and then I was able to run the server with ` python3 hello_world.py `
